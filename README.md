# Trapped_Mouse

Write an application that lets a user move a “mouse” within a box.

The input commands to the program consist of F (move forwards one mouselength), L (turn left), R (turn right). Write a model that remembers the position of the mouse in the box and the direction the mouse is pointed; the model will have methods that let the mouse move forwards and turn left and right. Then, write an output view that draws a picture of the mouse within the box. Finally, write a controller that transfers the commands to the model.
